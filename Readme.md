                                          Project Title:- Digital Subscription Manager.


Idea Brief:
The Digital Subscription Manager is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the management of recurring subscriptions. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this platform offers users an intuitive and efficient way to track, manage, and optimize their subscriptions.
With a user-friendly dashboard, the application provides real-time insights into active subscriptions, renewal dates, associated costs, and budgeting trends. By leveraging data analytics and smart notifications, it ensures users stay informed about their financial commitments while helping them make cost-effective decisions regarding their subscriptions.

Key Features:
1 Authentication & Security
User Authentication: Google Sign-In, Email, and Password authentication
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enhanced security with Google Authenticator or OTP verification
Secure Session Management: Cookie-based authentication for secure logins
Logout & Session Termination: Ensures user data privacy and session control
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign different roles such as Owner, Admin, and Member
Custom Permissions: Granular access control for managing user roles and data

2 Subscription Management & Organization
Manage Multiple Subscriptions: Add, edit, and categorize subscriptions
Subscription Sharing: Invite family members or team members to shared subscriptions
